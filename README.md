### Sup, Losers 👉😎👉

I'm Jordan!

I've always sat on the fence between dev and ops, and over time I've developed a passion for building dev tools that make working with the cloud and deploying applications an enjoyable experience. 😁

I enjoy giving back to the community! I'm one of the organisers of [Monitoring.Sydney](https://monitoring.sydney), and this one time I helped organise [DevopsDays Sydney](https://www.devopsdayssydney.org/).

Currently working in Observability @Atlassian, so I've been enjoying getting to work on the things I'm passionate about for my day job ✨

- 🔭 Doing some design work on setting up an edge router for developers building micro-sites. 
- 🤓 Currently learning some Rust, and tinkering with some CDK and cdk8s stuff
- 👬 I'm keen to get more involved with observability projects
